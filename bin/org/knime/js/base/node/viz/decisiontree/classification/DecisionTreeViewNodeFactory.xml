	<name>Decision Tree View (JavaScript)</name>
	
	<shortDescription>
	    A JavaScript based plot of the provided decision tree.
	</shortDescription>
		
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>		
    	    <p>A plot of the provided decision tree using a JavaScript based library. The view can be accessed either via
            the "interactive view" action on the executed node or in a KNIME Server web portal page. 
	       	</p>
	       	<p>The view shows a decision tree consisting of a number of nodes.
	       	The class label and the class counts displayed inside the nodes correspond to those of the training data.
	       	This especially means that the shown frequencies do not correspond to the rows used for selection (unless you use the full training dataset for selection). </p>
            <p>The configuration of the node lets you choose the number of rows to be used for selection and to enable certain 
            controls, which are then available in the view. This includes the possibility to set a title. Enabling or disabling these controls via the configuration
            dialog might not seem useful at first glance but has benefits when used in a web portal/wizard execution 
            where the end user has no access to the workflow itself.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally a static SVG image can be rendered, which is then made available at the first output port.</p>
            <p>Note, this node is currently under development. Future versions of the node might have more or changed functionality.</p>
            <p>
	        The node supports custom CSS styling. 
	        You can simply put CSS rules into a single string and set it as a flow variable 'customCSS' 
	        in the node configuration dialog. 
	        You will find the list of available classes and their description on our <a href="https://knime.com/css-styling">documentation page</a>.
